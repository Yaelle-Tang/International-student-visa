        After a three-week pause in student visa interviews this summer and newly expanded travel bans under the Trump
        administration, international student arrivals to the U.S. fell by 19% this August. It was the steepest
        non-pandemic decline on record. We want to uncover what is truly behind this drop, what the underlying story
        is that people are experiencing, and how these political decisions are impacting students’ lives. For
        instance, there are many Chinese students in the U.S. who are talking about this on personal Chinese podcasts.
        They worry about being forced to leave the country or being denied entry, especially those in sensitive STEM
        fields.<br /><br />We will plan to combine government data on visa delays and student arrivals with personal
        stories from students who’ve been stuck, delayed, or forced to change their plans. Likewise, it will address
        how the drop in international student enrollment is affecting university funding and how countries in the EU
        and China are wooing talented students rejected by America.<br /><br />The New York Times has already mapped
        the decline, but its story stops at the national level. This story will zoom in on the human and local
        dimensions, using both visuals and personal storytelling to explore how federal policy ripples through
        university campuses.<br /><br />After a three-week pause in student visa interviews this summer and newly
